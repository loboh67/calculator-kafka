# Distributed Calculator Service

This project implements a distributed calculator using Spring Boot and Kafka. It consists of two microservices:

- **REST Service**: Exposes an HTTP API to receive calculation requests from clients.
- **Calculator Service**: Consumes calculation requests from Kafka, performs the computation, and sends back the result.

## ðŸ§± Architecture
Client â†’ REST API â†’ Kafka Topic â†’ Calculator Service â†’ Kafka Response â†’ REST API (response)

Each HTTP request is assigned a unique `requestId` which is propagated throughout the system using MDC for traceability.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Supports `sum`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`
- Uses Kafka for asynchronous request/response communication
- MDC-based logging with `requestId` tracking
- Includes unit tests
